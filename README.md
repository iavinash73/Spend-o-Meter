## Copilot Usage
- **Enhanced Code Suggestion**: Copilot provided me with powerful code suggestions, autocompleted functions and methods and reduced the chances of syntax errors or typos.
- **Efficient Error Handling**: Copilot assisted me in error handling by suggesting common error handling patterns, helping me catch and handle exceptions, validate inputs, and provide meaningful error messages.
- **Error Correction Assistance**: Copilot helped me identify and correct errors in my code by suggesting fixes for syntax errors, missing or misplaced brackets, parentheses, or semicolons.
- **Accelerated Development**: By automating parts of my coding process, Copilot sped up my development by generating boilerplate code for common tasks, allowing me to focus on the core logic of my application.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Copilot's code suggestions contributed to better code quality by identifying potential bugs, recommending refactoring options, and adhering to best practices, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable code.

## Additional Features (Future Scopes)

- **Collaboration Feature**: Enable collaboration between users, allowing them to share and collaborate on expense tracking. Users can invite others to join their financial group, share expenses, and view real-time updates. This feature promotes financial transparency and facilitates joint expense management, such as shared household expenses or group trips.

- **Real-Time Price Comparison**: Implement a real-time price comparison feature that allows users to compare the prices of products or services with market prices. Users can search for a specific item or scan a barcode, and the application will provide real-time price comparisons from various online retailers or local stores. This feature empowers users to make informed purchasing decisions and find the best deals available.

- **Lens/Scan Feature**: Implement a lens/scan feature that allows users to capture and extract expense information directly from bills or receipts. This feature can utilize optical character recognition (OCR) technology to extract relevant data such as vendor name, date, and amount, making expense tracking more convenient and efficient.
